nanomod/seq_tools.py: include wildcard expansion 
nanomod/seq_tools.py: can we turn this into a more generalised method? how?
nanomod/seq_tools.py: maybe we should methylated the reference genome instead?
nanomod/__main__.py: make this ranked? eg force 1, force 8?
nanomod/__main__.py: should we modify datafraction in case we have drastically different amounts of data for modified and canonical?
nanomod/expand_model_alphabet.py: Make methylation / demethylation more general. 
nanomod/scripts/create_serial_net.py: use argparse 
nanomod/scripts/build_eventalign_from_simulation.py: add options for 1D, 1D template only, 2D 
nanomod/scripts/select_data_fraction.sh: Allow one or both input files to be empty. 
nanomod/scripts/select_data_fraction.sh: Allow a random seed / just take head instead of shuf 
nanomod/embed_eventalign.py: deal with secondary / auxiliary reads better 
nanomod/embed_eventalign.py: remove unlabelled events - is this helpful?
nanomod/embed_eventalign.py: check if this read passes or fails
nanomod/embed_eventalign.py: can we determine kmer length earlier?
nanomod/embed_eventalign.py: count size of skip, take negative into account
nanomod/utils.py: can we move away from shell calls?
nanomod/check_skip_stay_prob.py: add method to check bounds given desired proportion 
nanomod/build_eventalign.py: why can't this handle more than eight cores? Arbitrary.
