    The gap penalty dictionary should be laid out as follows:
        {start0: penalty for aligning sequence 0 before the start of sequence 1,

        The only required field is open0. Gap extension values will default to being the same
        as opening a gap. Start and end gap penalties default to being the same as the extension
        penalty. And the second set of penalties will default to the values for the first.
    .. note::
       Resulting alignment is in terms of 3mers. So '0' represents bases 0-2, and the
       largest  value in the alignment will be len(sequence) - 3. Since the alignment is
       done in terms of 3mers, if the sequence was generated from 5mers then the first and
       last base should be discarded before calling this function.
