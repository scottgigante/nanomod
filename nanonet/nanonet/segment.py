    or may not be present between the two abasics, due to the strand moving too fast. However, we're
    going to ignore that possibility for the moment, as we haven't got any evidence suggesting that
    it's an issue.

    Abasic candidates are prioritized based on (in order):

        * pT length
        * lower pT height
        * abasic height
        * abasic total length

    .. note::
       Because this is (currently) running in parallel with _find_abasic, and the abasics used in
       the double hairpins are six times as long as the other ones, this should be called with
       min_peak_dur equal to somewhere near six times what it would have been during a normal
       _find_abasic call.

          a single large abasic which has subsumed the pT then this could theoretically end up as
