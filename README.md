### Nanomod: version 0.0.1 ###

This is a project designed to call base modifications on Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION sequencing data. Check back soon for more developments.

A working development for generating nanonet training datasets has been developed and is stored permanently under the branch 'nanonet' and release tag 'nanonet'. Further developments under the dev and master branches may approach training data generation for alternative training suites.
