### Nanomod: version 0.0.1 ###

This is a project designed to call base modifications on Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION sequencing data. Check back soon for more developments.

A working development for generating nanonet training datasets has been developed and is stored permanently under the branch 'nanonet' and release tag 'v0.0.1-nanonet'. Further developments under the dev and master branches may approach training data generation for alternative training suites.
